# 0782_Project_Restaurant

The First Project of the Course and my first C++ Project, I developed a restaurant menu, to improve my skills using different classes. In this project I had a menu where i could add and remove, dishes, drinks and clients. Next step was to order products from the menu and calculate it's price. I created a way to issue receipts from each order. The last step was to report the client with most number of orders, best and worst-selling dish and drink, and the highest-profit dish from the entire sale list.
